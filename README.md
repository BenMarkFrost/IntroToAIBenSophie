# IntroToAIBenSophie

This repository will host the development of code for the coursework required for the Introduction to AI module.

We will be researching the classification of gestures of hands in a live video.

### Project setup:

To set up this project, git clone this repository into a new folder, and download the zipped 'HandsData/' directory from one of the following mirrors:

• https://www.dropbox.com/s/e0754zr9uqcxz2v/Benjamin%20Sophie%20AI%20HandsData.zip?dl=0 <br />
• https://mega.nz/file/bc4whQ7C#bEINO1sIPLZX1BT3hzEfEUMDLVuzOwDLMMS0PurVimc <br />
• https://1drv.ms/u/s!Avo4Y0d8-KBZmpgT9hgmIDoiSERuoQ?e=vag0ju

Extract the downloaded file and place the directory 'HandsData/' on the same level as the CreateCNNModel.ipynb and HandRecognition.ipynb notebooks.

The folder ‘Research’ includes some examples of research and testing that were carried out before reaching the final product, however these are not essential to this report.
