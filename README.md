# IntroToAIBenSophie

This repository will host the development of code for the coursework required for the Introduction to AI module.

We will be researching the classification of fruit using images and other features.

### Project setup:

To set up this project, git clone this repository into a new folder, and download the data files from one of the following mirrors:

• https://www.dropbox.com/s/b2r0cb4aav7c6tv/Benjamin%20Sophie%20AI%20Data.zip?dl=0
• https://mega.nz/file/GJRVXChZ#UHtMmYrbSndvNANZgIexFiXzJKaIdX2WMpSmYiEezXY

Two main notebooks accompany this report: CreateCNNModel.ipynb (With accompanying data in ‘HandsData/’), and HandRecognition.ipynb (with accompanying models in ‘Model Versions/’). Further to this, the folder ‘Research’ includes some examples of research and testing that were carried out before reaching the final product, however these are not essential to this report.

The final tree for the code and data should look as follows:

•	CreateCNNModel.ipynb
•	HandRecognition.ipynb
•	HandsData/
  o One/
    	Images of one finger.jpg
  o	None/
    	Images of no fingers.jpg
  o SelectiveSearch.jpg
•	Model Versions/
  o	HandModelV#.h5
•	Research/
  o	Further research notebooks.
